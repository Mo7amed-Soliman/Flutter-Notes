### Introduction

In Dart, `typedef` is used to create custom type aliases for function signatures or complex types. This improves code readability and reusability.
#### Use Cases of `typedef`

- Defining function types for callbacks.
    
- Simplifying complex type definitions for structured data.
    
- Creating generic function types for better flexibility.

### 1. Typedef for Function Types

Imagine an app for organizing tasks, where you want to handle operations like marking a task as done or deleting it.

```dart
typedef TaskAction = void Function(String task);

void markAsDone(String task) {
  print('Task "$task" marked as done.');
}

void deleteTask(String task) {
  print('Task "$task" deleted.');
}

void main() {
  TaskAction action = markAsDone;
  action("Buy groceries"); // Output: Task "Buy groceries" marked as done.
  
  action = deleteTask;
  action("Buy groceries"); // Output: Task "Buy groceries" deleted.
}
```
- ⚠️ In a real-world app, such functions could be wired to button actions.

### 2. Typedef for Complex Types

Consider a school management system that stores student grades per subject.

```dart
 typedef GradesMap = Map<String, List<int>>;
 
void main() {
  GradesMap studentGrades = {
    'Math': [95, 85, 80],
    'Science': [90, 88, 92],
  };

  print(studentGrades);
  // Output: {Math: [95, 85, 80], Science: [90, 88, 92]}
}
```
- ⚠️ Such maps could be retrieved from a database in an education app.

### 3. Typedef with Generics

Picture an e-commerce app processing payments in various currencies. A generic operation might convert values based on the type.

```dart
typedef ConversionOperation<T> = T Function(T amount, double rate);

double convertToUSD(double amount, double rate) => amount * rate;
int calculateDiscount(int price, double rate) => (price * rate).toInt();

void main() {
  ConversionOperation<double> usdConverter = convertToUSD;
  print(usdConverter(100.0, 0.9)); // Output: 90.0
  
  ConversionOperation<int> discountCalculator = calculateDiscount;
  print(discountCalculator(200, 0.15)); // Output: 30
}
```
